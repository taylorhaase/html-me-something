        <h1>The Good, The Bad, The Ugly of Caring for a Newborn Human</h1>

        <p>I am now a year and a half into parenthood and I can say with 100% certainty that no one can prepare anyone 
            for the grueling task of taking care of a baby for the first time. That being said, I have learned a few things
            and what kind of New Mom would I be if I didn't try to bestow that wisdom upon you? So read on and You're Welcome.
        </p>
        <p><h3>The Bad</h3></p>

        <p>I'll start with the bad because why not? Parenting is an exhausting and somewhat soul sucking experience that will 
            have you questioning everything you know about yourself, your parents, and society as whole.
        </p>
        <p>Want to go to your favorite brewery for some cold drinks and a burger on a Saturday afternoon? Think again. 
            The new Star Wars just came out and you'd like to catch it on the big screen with a bucket of popcorn? 
            Dream on. You'd love to lie in the sun and nod off to a good book one of these days? Hilarious.
        </p>
        <p>Becoming a parent takes a huge chunk of your freedom and hurls it right into the nearest dumpster.
            Luckily, there are moments that make it ALL worth it...
        </p>

        <p><h3>The Good</h3></p>

        <p>If you love to feel so much pure joy that you might actually burst - your baby will provide that. There is no amount 
            of chocolate, bacon, beer, rainbows, or butterflies that can trump the moment your baby looks up at you and smiles
            for the first time. Or laughs for the first time. Crawls. Walks. Calls you "Mama" or "Dada." These moments are what
            you will live for.
        </p>
        <p>When your baby starts to turn into a toddler, you will be blown away by how much this little human has been able to
            learn in a very short amount of time. Your baby's healthy development will be your #1 priority. You will have an almost
            painful ear-to-ear grin watching your little one triumph over that step that seemed too big to crawl up yesterday. 
        </p>
        <p>Becoming a parent is chock-full of amazing moments and you will wish to be present for each of them.</p>
        <p><h3>The Ugly</h3></p>

        </div>
        <p>In the early months, there is a never ending supply of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Poop</li>
            <li>Pee</li>
            <li>Spit-up</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You're too exhausted to keep up with laundry so even if you manage to climb your way out of the monstrous mound of 
            dirty clothes, you will inevitably just end up reaching for the first thing that covers you enough to avoid an arrest.
            The world may not approve of your sweats and dirty tee but by golly, you got yourself 
            out the door and that in itself is a small miracle. 
        </p>
        <p>I won't get into ALL of the ugly bits but rest assured when you think you've seen it all - to quote Bachman Turner Overdrive -
            "You ain't seen nothin' yet."
        </p>
