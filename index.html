        <h3>How I Met My Dog, Summer</h3>

        <p>Way back in May of 2007, I got word of a litter of free puppies that were ready for their new homes out in Arlington, WA.
            They were mutts, a mix of German Sheperd, Australian Shepherd, and Blue Heeler. An &quot;Oops litter&quot; is what the man
            called these pups. The best dang &quot;Oops&quot; I've ever known!
        </p>
         <p>   
            I followed my printed mapquest directions and arrived at 
            the farm, greeted by 5 wagging tails who were playing outside. There was a sixth puppy, but she was 
            glued to her mom and wasn't interested in anyone else. I played with each of those first 5 pups until finally, 
            about an hour later, the sixth one decided she might come and say hello also. She wasn't overly excited, but 
            still very friendly. She warmed up and, before long, started following me wherever I walked. I knew she was the one.
            On the car ride home, we started thinking of a name for her. <span>&quot;Summer&quot;</span> was an instant fit and that's what we've called her
            ever since.   
        </p>

        <p><h3>A Bit About Summer</h3></p>
        <p>Over the last 10 years, Summer has been by my side every day. She has seen relationships begin and end, jobs come and go
            and has endured move after move with me.   
        </p>
        <p>She's not a typical go-fetch kind of dog. Trying to describe her would almost sound like I were describing a cat:
            sort of aloof, affectionate when she chooses, and not as eager to please as she is to be pleased. She won't gobble
            down any scrap of food you put infront of her without first inspecting it 
            and she'll almost never show interest in a tennis ball.  
        </p>
        <p>She cares deeply for her family and I know she would do anything to protect us. She can be super playful if you
            know the games she likes to play. One of her favorites is to pretend she can swim - she'll run into the water and
            splash around like a fish then dart out and chase her people until she runs back into the water. She'll only ever
            eat half of her bowl of food at a time. She gives hugs
            and loses her mind with excitement every time I come home from work.  
        </p>
        <ul class= "FavThings"><h4>Some of Summer's Favorite Things:</h4>
            <li>Family</li>
            <li>Ear Rubs</li>
            <li>Stupid Squirrel (the only toy she's ever loved)</li>
            <li>The Beach</li>
            <li>Car rides</li>
            <li>Fried Rice</li>
            <li>Sitting on The Rear Window Ledge in the Car (even though she's too big)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Nicknames</h3></p>
        <p>To know Summer is to know at least a few of her many nicknames...
        </p>
        <ul class="Nicknames">
            <li>&quot;Sum&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Chicken&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Micken&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Butt&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Chick&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;ChickButt&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;SumButt&quot;</li> 
            <li>&quot;Micken Bo Bicken&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Micken Licken Chicken&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Summy&quot;</li>
